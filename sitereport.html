        <h1> Web Development Report </h1>
        <p>I have learnt a lot of new things in web development mainly the basics when creating a website. I’ve learnt how to do headers, footers, sidebars, how to add images and create tables in my work. I’ve also learnt the differences between HTML and CSS, which HTML is a programming language that is used to create static web pages and has a tag to start and end with a code. Whereas CSS is a style sheet language that is responsible for the design and style for the website including colours, sizes, and layout.</p>
    <p>Throughout this module I have done a lot of coding which has been new to me as I haven’t done html before, so it was quite new, but I learnt new things gradually every week. One thing that has been frustrating is when there’s an error with the code so the debugging process and you must try and fix the problem. This would take a lot of time to try and solve the error as you must get each code right or the outcome will not come out great. But the HTML validator has helped me solve the problem and made it easier for me by telling me where to look at. </p>
