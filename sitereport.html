        <h1> Web Development Report </h1>
<ul> 
    <li><p>I have learnt a lot of new things in web development mainly the basics when creating a website. I’ve learnt how to do headers, footers, sidebars, how to add images and create tables in my work. I’ve also learnt the differences between HTML and CSS, which HTML is a programming language that is used to create static web pages and has a tag to start and end with a code. Whereas CSS is a style sheet language that is responsible for the design and style for the website including colours, sizes, and layout.</p></li>
    
    <li><p>Throughout this module I have done a lot of coding which has been new to me as I haven’t done html before, so it was quite new, but I learnt new things gradually every week. Overall, I have enjoyed the module as I always wanted to create a website, so this helped me as now I know the basics of web development and how to code and I feel confident in the future to be able to create more web pages.</p></li>
